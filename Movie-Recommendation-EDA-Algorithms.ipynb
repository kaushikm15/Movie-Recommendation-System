    "## <font color=green> Executive Summary </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The overall goal of this project is the implementation of several machine learning algorithms to build movie recommendation systems for users of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green> Datasets </font>\n",
    "### The datasets used in this project is the MovieLens datasets. This is one of the many movie datasets provided by GroupLens. They contain information on movies and their features, such as the title, runtime, budget, languages produced in etc. Other datasets used were the ratings dataset which contained the user ID, movie ID and user rating. These datasets were linked to one another by a third dataset which contained a movie's IMDb ID, TMDb ID and movie ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green> EDA </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Initially, an Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the datasets. <br> - This involved checking the data types of all features in the movie dataset, changing runtime and revenue occurances of 0 to NaNs as a movie that had already been released would have gotten some value geater than 0 for each of these features. <br>  - Features such as Popularity and vote count had non-numeric values in them and hence were converted to NaNs to indicate unavailable information in those cells. <br> - Then the numerical features were standardized to compare the range of values in a boxplot. <br> - Then features such as revenue, runtime, budget, popularoty and vote averages were fed into a correlation plot to check for any underlyring relationships between variables. <br> - A barplot was plotted to view the number of movies produced in each language to get a sense of which languages were present in the movies and what could be expected from the recommendations.<br>  - From the movies dataset, data was grouped by each movie to understand how many ratings each movie received and what was the average rating received from all users. <br> - This gave a good understanding of the most rated movies and what could show up in recommendations. <br> - A distribution plot of rating averages was plotted for all movies to get a sense of rating behaviours of all users ( most ratings were between 3.25 and 4.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green> Algorithms </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green> K-Nearest Neighbours </font>\n",
    "### The ml-100k data is used in this case. The K-nearest neighbours uses Correlation as the similarity metric. The active user's average rating is used as the starting point. Then the sum of the ratings given by these k-nearest neighbours of the active user asjusted by their mean rating is added to this starting point. This is the predicted rating for a movie that the active user has not seen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green> Latent-factor based model </font>\n",
    "### This method is based on matrix factorization and decomposes the user-movie rating matrix to predict a movie that an active user has not seen. The decomposition of the user-movie rating matrix is based on rating values that are not null. This eliminates the issue of having a sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green> SVD using Surprise library </font>\n",
    "### Singular Value Decomposition is based on Matrix Factorization but in this case the Surprise library uses a different method to decompose the user-movie matrix. The SVD++ method is used as an evaluation is performed of all available algorithms based on a 5-fold cross-validation using the RMSE metric. Using this algorithm, predictions are calculated for all movies that a user has not seen/rated yet and the top n recommendations are given out based on how many recommendations the user wants to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=green> Apriori algorithm </font>\n",
    "### This algorithm is to show associations between movies and recommend movies that are associated based on other movies chosen by the user. Support and Confidence are the two metrics used to decide associations between movies.\n",
